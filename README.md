Uncertainty estimation in deep learning â€“ the big challenge of trustworthy AI - is sparse and we are still stuttering. While in certain application fields, especially in autonomous systems and healthcare it is crucial to build trust in a model and being able to understand its behavior. Based on a series of published research works in top AI venues. My aim is to provide machine learning engineers and practitioner with useful guidelines to help them to assess the uncertainty of their models.

Upcoming development. I am going to cover the state-of-art models of deep learning uncertainty quantification in a more a friendly-way, away from the mathematical complications. Below, useful git-hub projects on uncertainty quantification in deep learning which I am working on at the moment.
